# Mesos Attributes & Resources

The Mesos system has two basic methods to describe the slaves that comprise a cluster.  One of these is managed by the Mesos master, the other is simply passed onwards to the frameworks using the cluster.

## Types

The types of values that are supported by Attributes and Resources in Mesos are scalar, ranges, sets and text.

The following are the definitions of these types:

    scalar : floatValue

    floatValue : ( intValue ( "." intValue )? ) | ...

    intValue : [0-9]+

    range : "[" rangeValue ( "," rangeValue )* "]"

    rangeValue : scalar "-" scalar

    set : "{" text ( "," text )* "}"

    text : [a-zA-Z0-9_/.-]

## Attributes

Attributes are key-value pairs (where value is optional) that Mesos passes along when it sends offers to frameworks. An attribute value supports 3 different *types*: scalar, range or text.

    attributes : attribute ( ";" attribute )*

    attribute : text ":" ( scalar | range | text )

## Resources

The Mesos system can manage 3 different *types* of resources: scalars, ranges, and sets.  These are used to represent the different resources that a Mesos slave has to offer.  For example, a scalar resource type could be used to represent the amount of memory on a slave.  Resources can be specified either with a JSON array or a semicolon-delimited string of key:value pairs.  If, after examining the examples below, you have questions about the format of the JSON, inspect the `Resource` protobuf message definition in `include/mesos/mesos.proto`.

As JSON:

    [
      {
        "name": "<resource_name>",
        "type": "SCALAR",
        "scalar": {
          "value": <resource_value>
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "<resource_name>",
        "type": "RANGES",
        "ranges": {
          "range": [
            {
              "begin": <range_beginning>,
              "end": <range_ending>
            },
            ...
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "<resource_name>",
        "type": "SET",
        "set": {
          "item": [
            "<first_item>",
            ...
          ]
        },
        "role": "<role_name>"
      },
      ...
    ]

As a list of key:value pairs:

    resources : resource ( ";" resource )*

    resource : key ":" ( scalar | range | set )

    key : text ( "(" resourceRole ")" )?

    resourceRole : text | "*"

Note that `resourceRole` must be one of the [roles](roles.md) that was defined when the Mesos master was started.

## Predefined Uses & Conventions

The Mesos master has a few resources that it pre-defines in how it handles them.  At the current time, this list consist of:

  - `cpus`
  - `mem`
  - `disk`
  - `ports`

In particular, a slave without `cpus` and `mem` resources will never have its resources advertised to any frameworks.  Also, the Master's user interface interprets the scalars in `mem` and `disk` in terms of *`MB`*.  IE: the value `15000` is displayed as `14.65GB`.

## Examples

Here are some examples for configuring the Mesos slaves.

    --resources='cpus:24;mem:24576;disk:409600;ports:[21000-24000,30000-34000];bugs(debug_role):{a,b,c}'

    --resources='[{"name":"cpus","type":"SCALAR","scalar":{"value":24}},{"name":"mem","type":"SCALAR","scalar":{"value":24576}},{"name":"disk","type":"SCALAR","scalar":{"value":409600}},{"name":"ports","type":"RANGES","ranges":{"range":[{"begin":21000,"end":24000},{"begin":30000,"end":34000}]}},{"name":"bugs","type":"SET","set":{"item":["a","b","c"]},"role":"debug_role"}]'

    --attributes='rack:abc;zone:west;os:centos5;level:10;keys:[1000-1500]'

Or given a file `resources.txt` containing the following:

    [
      {
        "name": "cpus",
        "type": "SCALAR",
        "scalar": {
          "value": 24
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "mem",
        "type": "SCALAR",
        "scalar": {
          "value": 24576
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "disk",
        "type": "SCALAR",
        "scalar": {
          "value": 409600
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ports",
        "type": "RANGES",
        "ranges": {
          "range": [
            {
              "begin": 21000,
              "end": 24000
            },
            {
              "begin": 30000,
              "end": 34000
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "bugs",
        "type": "SET",
        "set": {
          "item": [
            "a",
            "b",
            "c"
          ]
        },
        "role": "debug_role"
      }
    ]

You can do:

    $ path/to/mesos-slave --resources=file:///path/to/resources.txt ...

In this case, we have five resources of three different types: scalars, a range, and a set.  There are scalars called `cpus`, `mem` and `disk`, a range called `ports`, and a set called `bugs`. `bugs` is assigned to the role `debug_role`, while the other resources do not specify a role and are thus assigned to the default role.

Note: the "default role" can be set by the `--default_role` flag.

  - scalar called `cpus`, with the value `24`
  - scalar called `mem`, with the value `24576`
  - scalar called `disk`, with the value `409600`
  - range called `ports`, with values `21000` through `24000` and `30000` through `34000` (inclusive)
  - set called `bugs`, with the values `a`, `b` and `c`, assigned to the role `debug_role`

In the case of attributes, we end up with five attributes:

  - `rack` with text value `abc`
  - `zone` with text value `west`
  - `os` with text value `centos5`
  - `level` with scalar value 10
  - `keys` with range value `1000` through `1500` (inclusive)
